**Project Title: SuperDeal - Online Auction Platform - Microservices with .NET and RabbitMQ**

## Overview

This project serves as a learning platform for implementing microservices architecture using .NET and RabbitMQ. The focus is on building an Online Auction Platform as a case study. The project aims to provide a practical guide for developers interested in understanding the fundamentals of microservices, .NET development, and message queuing with RabbitMQ.

## Features

- **Microservices Architecture:** Learn how to design and implement microservices for scalability and maintainability.
- **.NET Development:** Understand the basics of .NET development, including ASP.NET Core for building web services.

- **RabbitMQ Integration:** Explore the integration of RabbitMQ as a message broker to facilitate communication between microservices.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites:**

   - Install [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
   - Set up [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html) on your local machine.

2. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lunadiotic/superdeal.git
   cd superdeal
   ```

3. **Build and Run:**

   - Follow the instructions in each microservice's README to build and run the services.

4. **Explore the Code:**
   - Dive into the codebase to understand the implementation details of each microservice.

## Microservices
